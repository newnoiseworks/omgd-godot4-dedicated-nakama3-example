# OMGD Godot 4 Dedicated Server with Nakama Example

This example should work alongside the [Getting Started](https://newnoiseworks.github.io/omgd/pages/getting-started/) section of the OMGD documentation. Check that out for information on how to start this up.

Afterwards, visiting http://localhost:3030 in your browser should show the built web version of the game client.

NOTE: Godot 4 web servers require an https context when deployed to the cloud. OMGD currently does not support https / ssl. For deployed versions, use the built executables in the `game/dist` folder, or run the game from Godot itself.
